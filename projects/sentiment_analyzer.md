description: "It's a website where I can display my projects and work experience. I built it using Next.js and TypeScript, then deployed it to Github pages using Next.js' static site generation feature and Github Actions. After every PR or a push to the main branch, a Github Action executes the static generation command and pushes the new files to a separate branch. This branch is configured as the Github pages branch."
