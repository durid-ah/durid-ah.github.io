                Hey! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Durid Ahmad and I am a computer science major interested in backend services and IoT, I enjoy solving puzzles, taking on 
                programming challenges and exploring the deeper layers of programming concepts.
                Here you can find links to some of the projects I am currently working on or have previously
                finished.

                Most of my backend projects are work related so I can't really show their source code on here, <br/>
                but I do have a Java backend currently under construction and it is a mock website for users to purchase Airline tickets, <br/>
                view and cancel, it contains endpoints in Java servlets that are connected to Azure SQL server using JDBC with a planned front end using Angular.,<br/>
                The code repository for this project is available <a href="https://github.com/duridah/PlaneTicketManager/tree/dbSetup">here</a>
