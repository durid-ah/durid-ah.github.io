                Hey! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Durid Ahmad and I am a computer science major interested in backend services and IoT, I enjoy solving puzzles, taking on 
                programming challenges and exploring the deeper layers of programming concepts.
                Here you can find links to some of the projects I am currently working on or have previously
                finished.
